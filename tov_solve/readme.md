# Solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations

In order to study Neutron Stars we can attempt to find out the Pressure and the Mass at any given radius.
Since NSs are compact objects, they are described by the TOV eqs which are the spherically symmetrical 
solution to Einstein's field equations.

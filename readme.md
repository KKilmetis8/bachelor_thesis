## Neutron Star Interiors for various EoS

This is the repository I've made to store the files for my BSc. Thesis.
I am studying the interiors of Compact Objects, mostly Neutron Stars (NSs).

I've begun by solving the newtonian hydrostatic equilibrium for a White Dwarf (WD). Starting with WDs is wise because they are better understood than the uncharted NSs. You can find these in `Newtonian`.

Afterwards, we I've solved the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations, which are the spherically symmetrical solutions of the Einstein equations in general relativity. These efforts are documented in the directory `TOV`.

I've also included an the file `testing rk4 and scipy`. At one point during this thesis, the scipy library I used was behaving erratically -due to a typo on my part- and in a troubleshooting attempt I run some diagnostics. These despite not being of much help, were an intersting excersise.
